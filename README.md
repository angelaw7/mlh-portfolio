# Angela's Flask Portfolio
## https://www.angela-mlh.duckdns.org/
A minimalistic blogging and portfolio website for the Production Engineering Track of the MLH Fellowship, developed with the Flask micro-web framework. Originally created with my Orientation Hackathon teammates, Lalo and Anh.
<br>

## Project Overview
This website was developed using the Flask micro web framework for the Orientation Hackathon. The main pages of this personal website are the About page, the Portfolio page, the Blog page, and the Contact page. The goal is to reflect the Fellow in terms of their previous projects and their ongoing work, as showcased on the blogging section. The Fellow would be able to add new blog posts over time to log and share their progress and Fellowship experience. The blog data is stored in an SQLite database.
