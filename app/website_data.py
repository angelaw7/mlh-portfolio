    "shortParagraph": "Hey! My name is Angela and I'm a Software and Biomedical Engineering student at McMaster University. I'm passionate about medicine and technology and I hope to integrate both fields to one day work on developing innovative medical devices. I love to learn new things and I will never turn down an opportunity to continue developing my skills and exploring my interests. I'm currently participating in the Production Engineering Track of the MLH Fellowship this summer, where I'm learning  about Production/Site Reliability Engineering and DevOps. I'm also exploring Full-stack Development and I've recently taken an interest in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. \nIf anything here piques your interests, feel free to reach out! I'd love to connect and have a chat.",
